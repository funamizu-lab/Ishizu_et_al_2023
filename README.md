# Ishizu_et_al_2023

### 1. System requirements
   
  All scripts were conducted to wrok on the MATLAB R2021a.

We tested to run the scripts by a normal desktop computer ( 64-bit Windows 10 Pro / Intel(R)Core(TM)i7-10700K CPU @ 3.8 GHz).

  

### 2. Demo

  Expected outputs were the figrues and the relevant source data in our paper.

  The run time of almost all scripts were within 1 minute (in 10 minutes at maximum).  


### 3. How to use

  You can get access to the spike and behavioral data from the following cites:
  
10.6084/m9.figshare.24319705

For the MATLAB code here to work, the above data are needed to convert into the appropriate intermediate files.

The costom codes for data preprocessing are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
