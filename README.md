# Ishizu_et_al_2024

### 1. System requirements
   
  All scripts were conducted to wrok on the MATLAB R2021a.

We tested to run the scripts by a normal desktop computer (64-bit Windows 10 Pro / Intel(R)Core(TM)i7-10700K CPU @ 3.8 GHz).

  

### 2. Demo

  Expected outputs were the figrues and the relevant source data in our paper.


### 3. How to use

  You can get access to the spike and behavioral data from the following link:
  
**DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10881334**

For the MATLAB code here to work, the above data including the appropriate intermediate files are needed.

1. Please download the code files and the intermediate files
2. Please set the path of the code files and the intermediate files in Matlab
3. Please change the adress written in the script (**makefile/auc_folders.m; makefile/fof_folders.m; makefile/mpfc_folders.m**) into the appropriate address of your local folder      
4. Please run the code according to the scpirt of **makefile/makeFigures.m**


### 4. Note

  Additionally, you can get the spike and behavioral data from the following link:
